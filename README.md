# SimpleAPIs
This repo contains small scale APIs that I have built to understand the workings of backend systems. ##

## First API - A simple assignment API built using FastAPI
### Tech stack - FastAPI, FastAPI Security and JWT for authentication, MongoDB for a db
### Functionality - Adding and removing authentication 

### Things I learnt (more like revisited): 
1. How to authenticate users and admins
2. CRUD Operations
3. Postman for validating API responses
